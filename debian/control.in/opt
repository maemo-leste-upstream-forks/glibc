Package: libc6-sparcv9
Architecture: sparc
Section: libs
Priority: extra
Pre-Depends: @libc@ (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: Shared libraries [v9 optimized]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for the UltraSPARC v9 ABI. It only
 needs to be installed on UltraSPARC machines. If you install this on a
 non-UltraSPARC, it wont even be used.
 .
 WARNING: Some commercial programs do not work well with these libraries.
 Most notably, IBM's JDK. If you experience problems with such
 applications, you will need to remove this package.

 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for i686 machines, and will only be
 used if you are running a 2.6 kernel on an i686 class CPU (check the 
 output of `uname -m').  This includes Pentium Pro, Pentium II/III/IV, 
 Celeron CPU's and similar class CPU's (including clones such as AMD 
 Athlon/Opteron, VIA C3 Nehemiah, but not VIA C3 Ezla).  
 .
