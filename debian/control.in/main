Description: GNU C Library: National Language (locale) data [support]
 Machine-readable data files, shared objects and programs used by the
 C library for localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) support.
 .
 This package contains tools to generate locale definitions from source
 files (included in this package). It allows you to customize which
 definitions actually get generated. This is a space-saver over how this
 package used to be, with all locales generated by default. This created
 a package that unpacked to an excess of 30 megs.

Description: GNU C Library: Precompiled locale data
 This package contains the precompiled locale data for all supported locales.
 A better alternative is to install the locales package and only select
 desired locales, but it can be useful on a low-memory machine because some
 locale files take a lot of memory to be compiled.

Description: GNU C Library: Name Service Cache Daemon
 A daemon which handles passwd, group and host lookups
 for running programs and caches the results for the next
 query. You should install this package only if you use
 slow services like LDAP, NIS or NIS+.
